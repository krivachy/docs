# Creating a Custom Timeline Entry

This page is intended for a technical audience that will be creating a Custom Timeline Entry.
Check out the [Custom Timeline Entry](/custom-timeline-entry) page for an overview.

## Getting started

Before making any API calls, we need to decide what we want the Custom Timeline Entry to look like. You can use the [Custom Timeline Entry playground](https://app.plain.com/developer/custom-timeline-entry-playground/) to prototype an entry.

In this example, we'll use the "Refund processed" template but the complete list of components that you can use in the Custom Timeline Entry is documented in [Plain UI Components](/ui-components).

We'll use the `upsertCustomTimelineEntry` mutation, which allows us to create a new Custom Timeline Entry or update one if it exists.
This mutation requires the following permissions:

- `timeline:create`
- `timeline:edit`

## Creating a Custom Timeline Entry

**This is important:** remember to replace `c_xxx` with an existing customer's id. You can get a customer ID by [upserting a customer](/customers-api/upsert/)

    ```ts /c_xxx/
    import { PlainClient } from '@team-plain/typescript-sdk';

    const client = new PlainClient({
        apiKey: 'plainApiKey_xxx',
    });

    const res = await client.upsertCustomTimelineEntry({
        customerId: 'c_xxx',
        title: 'Refund processed',
        components: [
            {
                componentText: {
                    text: 'Invoice **#1301** was refunded to customer',
                },
            },
            {
                componentSpacer: {
                    spacerSize: 'XS',
                },
            },
            {
                componentText: {
                    textSize: 'L',
                    textColor: 'SUCCESS',
                    text: '**+ $413.20**',
                },
            },
            {
                componentDivider: {
                    spacingSize: 'M',
                },
            },
            {
                componentLinkButton: {
                    url: 'https://stripe.com',
                    label: 'View in Stripe',
                },
            },
        ],
    });

    if (res.error) {
        console.error(res.error);
    } else {
        console.log(res.data);
    }
    ```

    Which will console.log:

    ```js
    {
        result: 'CREATED',
        timelineEntry: {
            id: 't_01H4BKTDKC1KBXTD5GB3M2NJBZ',

## Side effects of Custom Timeline Entries

When upserting a Custom Timeline Entry, you can also optionally specify any side effects which allow you to control what happens after you create a new Custom Timeline Entry.

This is to support different kinds of entries. For example, when a significant error happens in your backend, and you create a Custom Timeline Entry, you might want to proactively reach out to the customer. Alternatively, if the customer makes a change to their account, you probably don't need to do anything.

#### `changeCustomerStatusToActive`

If set to `true`, the customer's state will change to `ACTIVE`, which will move them to the Waiting for Help queue. A notification will be sent (depending on notification settings) exactly as if a customer got in touch via email or chat.

#### `sendCustomTimelineEntryCreatedNotification`

If set to `true`, a notification will be sent **to the user assigned to the customer**, if they have the corresponding setting enabled in their notification settings.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💁‍♂️">

It's perfectly valid to set both of these fields to `true` at the same time. If you do this, the customer's state will move to `ACTIVE` and a notification will be sent to the assigned user and/or every other user in the workspace.

</Callout>
