# Receiving emails in Plain

To receive emails, you need to set up email forwarding from your company's support email address (e.g. `help@yourcompany.com`)
to your Plain workspace's inbound email address. Your workspace's inbound email address ends with `@inbound.postmark.app` and
can be found in under **Settings** → **Email**.

<Callout type="info" emoji="️✋">
This assumes you use Google Workspace (formerly called Google Apps) to manage your domain's emails.

If your email provider is not Google, you can still set up email forwarding in different ways, such as with your domain registrar (e.g. [DNSimple](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/email-forwarding/)) or your email provider (e.g. [Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/email/configure-email-forwarding)).
