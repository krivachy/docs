## Logged-out chat

By default, chat requires your users to authenticate their email so we can securely present their details to you in Plain.
Once you have chat set up, you can bypass email verification by [using your own site's authentication.](logged-in)

        Let's start by installing the npm package. In your app directory, run:

        ```shell
        npm install @team-plain/react-chat-ui
        ```

        This package exports:

        - A `Chat` component that renders the Plain chat.
        - A custom `usePlain` hook which exposes: a function to log out and the number of unread messages for the customer
        - The `PlainProvider` that provides context for the `Chat` component and the `usePlain` hook.

        To use the chat UI on your website, you need to wrap your app with the `PlainProvider` and use the `Chat` component wherever you want to show the chat UI.

        <Callout type="warning">
        Unlike when using chat via the script tag â€” which automatically adds a floating chat bubble to your website â€” the `Chat` component will fill its parent and is just the chat UI. This means you have full flexibility in terms of **where** and **how** you want to show the chat.
        </Callout>

        A basic example would look like this:

        ```tsx /APP_KEY/
        import React from 'react';

        import { PlainProvider, Chat } from '@team-plain/react-chat-ui';

        function PlainChat() {
            return (
                <PlainProvider appKey="APP_KEY">
                    <h1>My App</h1>
                    <Chat/>
                </PlainProvider>
            );
        }
        ```

        Replace `APP_KEY` with your app key that you [created earlier](./app-key/), which should look something like `appKey_uk_01GG7XEXD24GQ20GWV7SYBS83X`.

        Finally, go to your workspace **Settings** â†’ **Chat** and click on "Enable chat".

        If you load your app now, you'll be able to chat using the `Chat`
        component and see customer messages show up under "Waiting for Help" in
        your workspace in the [Support App](https://app.plain.com).

        To support logged-in users on your website, continue to the [support for logged-in users](./logged-in) page.

        <Callout emoji="ðŸŽ¨" type="info">
            The React Chat UI can be customized with a custom theme. Check out
            how in the [theming](./theming) section.
        </Callout>
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
        To find and integrate the chat script tag, click on your workspace name and go to **Settings** â†’ **Chat**.

        Select the app you [created earlier](./app-key/) and it will give you a code snippet (with your app key already included) to copy and paste into any page(s) you want the chat UI to show up.

        This is an example of a very minimal web page with Plain chat integrated. If you copy this make sure to replace `APP_KEY` with the app key that you created earlier.

        ```html filename="index.html" /APP_KEY/
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
            <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"/>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
            <title>Your website</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        <h1>Website</h1>
        <script>
            window.$plain = window.$plain || [];
            typeof plain === 'undefined' && (plain = function () { $plain.push(arguments); });
            plain("init", {appKey: "APP_KEY"});
        </script>
        <script async src="https://customer-chat.cdn-plain.com/latest/customerChat.js"></script>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```

        Finally, go back to your workspace **Settings** â†’ **Chat** and click "Enable chat".

        If you don't need to support logged-in users, this is all you need to do! Your users will now be able to chat with you, and they will show up in your workspace in the [Plain](https://app.plain.com).

        If your website has logged-in users, you can add [support for logged-in users](./logged-in/) in the next section.
