Support for logged-in users

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘‰">
  This guide assumes you've completed the logged-out chat setup. If you haven't, please head over to
  the [logged-out chat setup](./logged-out) first.
</Callout>

This guide will talk you through how to set up chat for customers who are logged into your app so they can skip the email authentication flow you get in the logged-out chat experience.

To securely authenticate your customers, you have to sign a JWT with the customer's details. Plain's chat will then exchange your JWT for a session token from Plain. This is a security measure to prevent bad actors from impersonating your users via chat.

There are two prerequisites before we are can configure chat to support logged-in users:

1. [Generating a key pair](#generate-key-pair)
2. [Creating customer JWTs](#create-customer-jwt)

## Generating a key pair [#generate-key-pair]

This assumes that you are working on macOS. If you are not, please get
in touch with us at [help@plain.com](mailto:help@plain.com), and we can
provide alternative methods to generate key pairs.

A private/public key pair is required to sign JWTs (on your server) and
verify them (on Plain's).

Let's create a key pair and add the public key to your workspace:

<Steps>

### Generate a key pair

Run the following in your terminal and follow the prompts:

```shell
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/team-plain/generate-rsa-key-script/main/generate_rsa_key_pairs.sh)
```

The source code of this script is here: https://github.com/team-plain/generate-rsa-key-script

After the script is done, it should have created a private key ending in `.key.pem` and a public key ending in `.key.pem.pub`.

### Add public key

Go to your workspace at [app.plain.com](https://app.plain.com) and open **Settings** â†’ **Apps**. Choose the one you created earlier. Then click on "Add Public Key"

### Choose a name

Choose a name for the public key (this is not shown publicly, so choose something that makes sense to you), paste its contents and click on "Create public key".

### Done!

After that, you should land back on the workspace app page. It means the public key has been added successfully.

</Steps>

## Creating customer JWTs [#create-customer-jwt]

Customer JWTs must be created and signed on your servers. Not doing so would mean exposing your private key, so anyone could impersonate your customers while getting in touch with Plain.

The JWT payload must conform to the following schema:

    ```ts
    type Customer = {
        fullName: string,
        shortName?: string,
        // Your customer's id in your own systems. This is what is used
        // to identify customers. If Plain receives a customer with the same externalId
        // as one we've seen before, we'll update any details that have changed. If not,
        // we'll create a new customer.
        externalId: string,
        email: {
            email: string,
            // Whether or not you have already established that the user has access
            // to the email address they've provided you; for example if they've
            // already verified their email on your app or website.
            isVerified: boolean,
        },
    }
    ```

    ]
    }
    ```

How you sign a JWT depends on the programming language you use in your backend.

Here is an example of how you could do this in NodeJS. The code assumes your
private key is exposed as an environment variable `PRIVATE_KEY` with no passphrase.

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const customer = {
  fullName: 'Garnett Hermann',
  shortName: 'Garnett',
  email: {
    email: 'garnett.hermann@aol.com',
    isVerified: false,
  },
  externalId: 'your_id',
};

const token = jwt.sign(customer, process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, {
  algorithm: 'RS256',
  expiresIn: '1h',
});
```

You can find a similar library for any language on [https://jwt.io/libraries](https://jwt.io/libraries).

The way you expose the JWT signing to your website is up to you.

You can embed the resulting customer JWT in the page, serve it from an API, etc. It doesn't really matter as long as the **JWT is generated server-side** and the **private key is kept secret**.

Once you have a way to create customer JWTs and expose them, you'll need to configure the chat UI to use the JWT.

In the rest of this guide, we'll assume that you decided to expose your customer JWT via API endpoint: `POST /api/get-customer-jwt`.

## Putting it all together

Now that we can generate a customer JWT we need to configure our chat to use it and authenticate customers.

        Besides the `appKey` prop, the `PlainProvider` also takes a prop
        called `customer`.

        The `customer` prop can be used to specify the current customer and let chat with you.

        To specify the logged-in customer you have to provide the following
        `customer` prop to the `PlainProvider` (replace `APP_KEY` with the key you obtained on [getting an app key](./app-key)):

        ```typescript jsx {4-14}
        import React from 'react';
        import { PlainProvider, Chat } from '@team-plain/react-chat-ui';

        const customer = {
            type: 'logged-in',
            getCustomerJwt: () => {
                // This assumes you have an endpoint that returns the customer
                // JWT which we setup in the above step
                return fetch('/api/get-customer-jwt/', { method: 'POST' })
                    .then(res => res.json())
                    .then(res => res.plain_customer_jwt);

            }
        }

        function App() {
            return (
                <PlainProvider appKey="APP_KEY" customer={customer}>
                    <h1>Your app</h1>
                    <Chat/>
                </PlainProvider>
            );
        }

        ReactDOM.render(<App/>);

        ```

        The most important part here is the `getCustomerJwt` function. This function must return a valid customer JWT.

        As a reminder: In this tutorial we're assuming that you are exposing the customer JWT via the API endpoint `/api/get-customer-jwt` but this could be different to what you ended up doing.

        The JWT you provide will then be used by Plain to authenticate the customer and allow them to chat.

        If you run your app now you should be able to chat in the `<Chat/>` component and see customer messages show up in your workspace in the [Support App](https://app.plain.com).

        The last thing to do is handle logging out of your app. When this happens, it's important you also log them out of Plain so they can't continue talk to you as if they were the logged in customer. You can do this using the `usePlain` hook:

        ```typescript jsx
        function LogoutButton() {
            const { logout } = usePlain();

            return (
                <button onClick={logout}>
                    Logout
                </button>
            );
        }
        ```

    </Tab>

    <Tab>
        If you already [set up the script tag](./logged-out) for logged-out users, you can update your code to
        include the highlighted part below by invoking the `set-customer` action.

        Make sure to replace `APP_KEY` with the key you obtained previously in the [getting an app key guide](./app-key)

        ```html filename="index.html" {10-16} /APP_KEY/
        <script>
            window.$plain = window.$plain || [];

            typeof plain === 'undefined' && (plain = function () { $plain.push(arguments); });

            plain("init", {
                appKey: "APP_KEY"
            });

            plain('set-customer', {
                type: 'logged-in',
                getCustomerJwt: () => {
                    return fetch('/api/get-customer-jwt/', {method: 'POST'})
                            .then(res => res.json())
                            .then(res => res.plain_customer_jwt);
                }
            });
        </script>
        <script async src="<https://customer-chat.cdn-plain.com/latest/customerChat.js>"></script>
        ```

        The most important part here is the `getCustomerJwt` function. This function must return a valid customer JWT.

        As a reminder: In this tutorial we're assuming that you are exposing the customer JWT via the API endpoint `/api/get-customer-jwt` but this might be different to what you ended up doing.

        The JWT you provide will then be used by Plain to authenticate the customer and allow them to chat.

        At this point your logged-in users will be able to send chat messages to you and you will able to see them in [Plain](https://app.plain.com).
