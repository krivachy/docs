Getting an app key

The first step in setting up chat is creating an app key. An app key is a unique key used to specify which workspace you are setting up chat for. It is safe to put this key in the source code of your
public website.

Let's create a new app key:

<Steps>

### Go to app settings

Open your workspace settings by clicking on your workspace name, then **Settings** â†’ **Apps**.

### Create a new app

Click on "New App" and enter a public and private name.
The public name should be something that can be shown to your customers e.g. "Chat".
The internal name will not be shown to your customers and should be something identifiable to you e.g. "Chat Marketing Website".

### Done!

The app key should now be shown at the top, it should look something like `appKey_uk_01GG7XEXD24GQ20GWV7SYBS83X`.

You don't need to take note of the app key right now. You can come back to this page later on and copy it.

If you are wondering about what "Public keys" are on this page: we will cover
them later on when setting up chat for logged-in customers.
