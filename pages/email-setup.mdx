# Setting up email

Setting up email requires you to complete two steps:

1. [Receiving emails in Plain](#receiving-emails)
2. [Sending emails from Plain](#sending-emails)

If you follow this guide, bear in mind that:

- All emails sent to that email address will be received by Plain (not your email provider's inbox)
- You can only configure one support email address per Plain workspace

If you need to receive a copy of each email sent to the support email address (for instance, to keep a copy in your
company's email inbox), there are ways to achieve this. Please get in touch with us by email
at [help@plain.com](mailto:help@plain.com), and we will be happy to help.

## What you will need

- Your support email address. See [what makes a good support email address?](#what-makes-a-good-support-email-address)
  below.
- Your Plain workspace's inbound email address (which ends with
  `@inbound.postmark.app`). We will provide this during the email setup process.
- Admin access to your domain's DNS settings.
- Admin access to your company's email provider.
  - If you use Google for email, you will need admin access to the Google Workspace Admin console.

## What makes a good support email address?

The only requirement is that your support email address uses your company's domain. Email addresses using `@gmail.com`
, `@yahoo.com`, `@icloud.com`, `@hotmail.com` or any other public email provider **are not supported**.

We recommend you choose an email address that is easy to remember and clear that it represents a company. Good
examples could be `help@`, `support@`, `contact@` or `hello@`. Generally, we'd advise against a personal one
like `sonia@` or `peter@` but they might also be fine, depending on your needs.

## Receiving emails in Plain

To receive emails, you need to set up email forwarding from your company's support email address (e.g. `help@yourcompany.com`)
to your Plain workspace's inbound email address. Your workspace's inbound email address ends with `@inbound.postmark.app` and
can be found in Plain's workspace settings under **Settings → Email**.

If you use Google for your emails, follow our guide to [receive emails in Plain with Google](email-setup/google)

## Sending emails from Plain

To be able to send emails from Plain using your support email
address, you will need to add a couple of DNS records to your domain.

While setting up your email, you will see DNS settings that need to be
configured for your domain:

<ImageContainer>![DNS settings](/images/email-setup/email-setup-4.png)</ImageContainer>

<Callout type="info" emoji="️👉">
**What are these records exactly?**

The first entry is the "DKIM record".
It is part of the available mechanisms that exist to authenticate
emails: verifying that you're the actual sender of the email.

The second one sets the return path for emails sent from Plain using your domain.
Return paths are used if an email bounces (fails to reach an inbox).

Both of them make sure that your emails reach your users' email inboxes
and do not end up in the spam folder.

Adding these to your DNS records varies slightly among different
providers. We have included a guide for different providers to help you
get going quickly:

Remember that in some cases, changes to DNS records may take some time
to propagate. For modern providers this should be less than 10 minutes,
but in extreme scenarios it may take 24-48 hours.
